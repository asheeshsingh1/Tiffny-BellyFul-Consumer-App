## Meta Info
* Currently the apps supports simple interaction of Consumer with restraunt and menu items registered with restraunt and create ratings for the same.
* A single Consumer can have multiple Orders with different or same restraunt, but therefore a single rating for a single order.
* Later every time when a Consumer places an order we insert that row in the PostGreSQL Database and same is being done for a Rating.
* So from Orders,Ratings Table, we will be able to fetch:

<ol>
    <li>All the Orders created by the Consumer</li>
    <li>Particular orders or Review rating created by the Consumer</li>
</ol>

* Instead of storing plain password in database, we can store hashed password using bcryptjs library of JS. While authenticating the user we can simple match the hashed password with the password stored in DB.
* We can also add a default page for requests that does not map for any url.
